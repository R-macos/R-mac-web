<h1>R for macOS</h1>
<h2>Development Tools and Libraries</h2>

For more details on compiling R, tools and libraries used for CRAN builds, please see <a href=https://mac.R-project.org/tools/>https://mac.R-project.org/tools/</a>
<p>&nbsp;

<h2>Previous tools</h2>

The following is provided as support of older versions of R. If you use R 4.0.0 or higher, please disregard and read the top section.

<p>R 3.5.0-3.6.3 El Capitan binaries and higer were using more recent Clang compiler and GNU Fortran 6.1 to provide OpenMP parallelization support and C++17 standard features. If you want to compile R packages from sources, please download GNU Fortran binary from the official <a href=https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries>GNU Fortran Binaries</a> page - in particular OS X 10.11 gfortran 6.1. Alternatively, we are providing a copy here as well as Clang binaries for OS X 10.11 and higher - see below for the download links.

Universal GNU Fortran 4.2.3 for Mac OS X 10.4 and higher. It is necessary in order to build R packages from sources that contain Fortran code.
<p>Unlike many other builds, this is a fully universal build of GNU Fortran that uses Apple's driver and supports all target architectures (i386, ppc, x86_64 and ppc64). As such it fully supports compilation into fat files like <tt>gfortran -arch i386 -arch ppc -arch x86_64 -arch ppc64 t.f -o t</tt>
on both Intel Macs and PowerPC Macs (32- and 64-bit). Dependent libraries are fat as well, avoiding problems known from other Fortran builds (such as those from HPC). It installs in <tt>/usr/local</tt> and comes with an uninstall-script.

<td width="70%">Development binary package for Mac OS X 10.4 or higher. It contains optional libraries that are necessary to enable capabilities in R as present in the CRAN binary. (Needed <i>only</i> if you want to compile R yourself!)<br>
Contents:<br>
<ul>
<li>libpng 1.2.32</li>
<li>libjpeg 6b</li>
<li>readline 5.2-12</li>
<li>pixman 0.12.0</li>
<li>freetype 2.3.7 (without and Quartz code and thus fork-safe)</li>
<li>fontconfig 2.6.0 (configured like Apple's build but with cache and config inside R)</li>
<li>cairo 1.8.0 (without Quartz code and thus fork-safe)</li>
</ul>
All libraries are built statically (except for readline which includes both a static and a dynamic library) for all four architectures (i386, x86_64, ppc and ppc64). All binaries are built with -fPIC such that they can be used in dynamically loaded code (such as R packages). The devpack is not necessary at runtime (except for readline if the dynamic version is used), it is only needed for compilation.
<p>
Fontconfig is configured in such way that its cache and configuration are under <tt>Resources/fontconfig</tt> in the R framework. The corresponding files are included in the above devpack. This allows stand-alone operation of R since the fontconfig supplied with Apple's X11 is too old and has bugs.

<p>
For other (optional) 3rd party libraries for development see <a href=http://mac.R-project.org/libs/>http://mac.R-project.org/libs/</a>. The <i>devpack</i> has been superseded by those libraries. For R you may want to download and install <i>libpng, libjpeg, readline, freetype, fontconfig, pixman</i> and <i>cairo</i>.
<p>
Source code for all 3rd party libraries can be found at <a href=http://mac.R-project.org/src/>http://mac.R-project.org/src/</a>
<p>
The dependency libraries used by the CRAN macOS build system are now managed by build <a href=https://github.com/s-u/recipes target=_new>recipes</a>. Package authors wishing to add static dependendies can create a pull request to add a dependency.

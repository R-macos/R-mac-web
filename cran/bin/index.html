  <h1>Binaries of libraries and tools for macOS</h1>

  This is the root for repositories hosting binaries and static
  libraries for macOS which are used to build R packages on CRAN based
  on the
  <a href="https://github.com/R-macos/recipes" target="_new">recipes</a>
  build system. The binaries are self-contained and can be used on their own.

  <h2>Quick Install</h2>

  To install any of the contained binaries, use the following R script:

  <pre>source("https://mac.R-project.org/bin/install.R")</pre>

  <p>It doesn't run anything, it only defines one R function
  <tt>install.libs</tt> which can download
  and install the corresponding binaries
  (<a href="https://github.com/R-macos/R-mac-web/blob/master/cran/bin/install.R"
      target="_new">view the script</a>). For example, to install the
  <tt>openssl</tt> library, use:</p>

  <pre>install.libs("openssl")</pre>

  <p>The default arguments will use this repository and will
  automatically determine the suitable binary for your system (if
  available). We are currently supporting Intel Macs with macOS 10.13
  (High Sierra) or higher and Apple Silicon (M1) Macs with macOS 11
  (Big Sur) and higher.</p>

  <p>NOTE: if you don't have write-permission in the installation location,
  you may need to make it writable or run <tt>sudo R</tt>.</p>

  <h2>Details</h2>

  <p>The following repostiories are currently provided:</p>

  <table width=60%>
    <tr align=left><th>Name</th><th>Installation Location</th><th>Target</th></tr>
    <tr><td><a href="darwin17/x86_64">darwin17/x86_64</a></td><td><tt>/usr/local</tt></td><td>macOS 10.13, Intel (x86_64)</td></tr>
    <tr><td><a href="darwin20/arm64">darwin20/arm64</a></td><td><tt>/opt/R/arm64</tt></td><td>macOS 11, Apple M1 (arm64)</tr>
  </table>

  <p>All binaries are built automatically using the 
    <a href="https://github.com/R-macos/recipes" target="_new">recipes</a>
    build system.</p>

  <p>Note that tools (such as subversion or emacs) can be downloaded
  individualy and don't require their build dependencies in order to
  be used, so you can use, for example:</p>

  <pre>install.libs("subversion", dep=FALSE)</pre>
    
  <p>The dependecies are only required for libraries to link
  against them.</p>

  <h2>Options</h2>

  <p>The <tt>install.libs</tt> function has following arguments:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><tt>pkgs</tt> - character vector, names of binaries to install</li>
    <li><tt>url</tt> - URL of the repostiory root</li>
    <li><tt>os</tt>, <tt>arch</tt> - name and version of the OS and
      the architecture to determine suitable repository.
      This is only used if <tt>os.arch="auto"</tt>.</li>
    <li><tt>os.arch</tt> - either name of the repository such as
      <tt>darwin20/arm64</tt> or <tt>auto</tt> if the most suitable
      repostiroy based on the above arguments <tt>os</tt>
      and <tt>arch</tT> is to be detected from the list of published
      repostiories at the <tt>url</tt> root.</li>
    <li><tt>dependencies</tt> - logical, if <tt>TRUE</tt> then
      build dependencies are also installed, otherwise only the listed
      packages are installed.</li>
    <li><tt>action</tt> - string, one of:
      <ul>
	<li><tt>"install"</tt> downloads and installs the
	  packages</li>
	<li><tt>"list"</tt> only returns the list of URLs to
	  download</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

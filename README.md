## R-mac-web
This repository contains the manually created content of the Mac part of CRAN, i.e., what lives in `/bin/macosx`.

Is does not contain all the binaries, sice they are huge (as of Feb 2021 more than 70Gb), but the idea is that users can submit PRs against this repository to improve the main macOS R page on CRAN if they so desire. Also it allows me to keep track of the updates over time.
